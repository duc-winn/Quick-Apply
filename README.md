# Quick-Apply

## Description

Quick-Apply is a job board application designed to streamline the often tedious and time-consuming tasks involved in job searching, such as securing referrals, tracking job applications, and monitoring the status of your applications and referrals. By compartmentalizing these tasks, Quick-Apply aims to cut the time spent on the job search process in half, allowing users to focus on simply applying while the application handles the rest.

Two standout features of Quick-Apply include its referral system and Google Maps integration:

- **Referral System**: Typically, getting a referral involves reaching out to employees via social platforms like LinkedIn, a process that can take weeks. Quick-Apply eliminates this waiting period by directly providing users with the employees' email addresses, allowing them to request referrals immediately. LinkedIn profiles are also provided if needed.

- **Google Maps UI**: Quick-Apply features a Google Maps-powered interface paired with a location-based algorithm that highlights job opportunities closest to the userâ€™s current location. This includes detailed company information, travel distances, and more. The user-friendly interface ensures an engaging and efficient job search experience, helping users reclaim valuable time for more important pursuits.

Quick-Apply is designed to make the job search process not only quicker but also more enjoyable, turning a typically stressful task into something engaging and productive.

## Full Stack Implementation

This full-stack application leverages industry-standard technologies to create a robust and efficient experience for users:

- **Backend**: Powered by ASP.NET and C#, the backend hosts all API services, including authentication and authorization mechanisms utilizing JWT tokens to enhance security.

- **Frontend**: The frontend is built with ReactJS and TypeScript, providing a scalable, responsive, and intuitive user interface. React Hooks and components handle the rendering of job data, employee referral details from third-party services, and the implementation of sign-in functionality. Users can easily perform CRUD operations on data stored in PostgreSQL, ensuring smooth interactions across the application.

Quick-Apply combines advanced technology with a focus on user experience, making the job search process as seamless and effective as possible.
